# --------------GADS-Learing-phase-II---projects--------------

# I have used the Qwiklabs My learning page dashboard as a proof of my project work, because of the fact that the Qwiklabs system for email confirmation is not working and it is not getting sent to my email.

## So i have used the https://run.qwiklabs.com/my_learning/labs dashboard page Screenshots

# I have created a folder for each labs and inside of each Lab folder i placed the Screenshot of the 100 %lab completion confirmation notification from the Qwiklabs homepage - https://run.qwiklabs.com/my_learning/labs

## In the following folders i have placed the “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions

    1. AK8S-10 Creating Services and Ingress Resources
    2. AK8S-12 Configuring Persistent Storage for Kubernetes Engine
    3. AK8S-09 Configuring Kubernetes Engine Networking
